Nasher Set Fix by Kaldor Silverwand
[version!]
https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/script/nwn2-oc-nasher-set-fix
Makes the Nasher item set available, it was not available ingame (and the unique ring appeared in two places). Adds cloak and gloves to OC and gives a set bonus.

Logram and Yaisog fix by kevL
v.160904
In module 1300_Old_Owl_Well, area 1319_eyegougerl2, Logram can't equip his arms and armor because he doesn't have the necessary proficiences and the items are not identified. Yaisog needs his arms and armor identified before he can equip them. This fix brings both NPCs to combat readiness.

Temple of Seasons fix by kevL
v.160907
The final dialog can be borked if an uncontrolled companion crosses its trigger. This fix changes the OnEnter script of the trigger, and ensures that only a controlled character can start the Purification Ritual. A second change is for the door to the final statue room, raising its DC from 18 to 99 so it's no longer an egregious exploit.
