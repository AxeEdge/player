Nasher Set Fix by Kaldor Silverwand
[version!]
https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/script/nwn2-oc-nasher-set-fix
Makes the Nasher item set available, it was not available ingame (and the unique ring appeared in two places). Adds cloak and gloves to OC and gives a set bonus.

Logram and Yaisog fix by kevL
v.160904
In module 1300_Old_Owl_Well, area 1319_eyegougerl2, Logram can't equip his arms and armor because he doesn't have the necessary proficiences and the items are not identified. Yaisog needs his arms and armor identified before he can equip them. This fix brings both NPCs to combat readiness.

Temple of Seasons fix by kevL
v.160907
The final dialog can be borked if an uncontrolled companion crosses its trigger. This fix changes the OnEnter script of the trigger, and ensures that only a controlled character can start the Purification Ritual. A second change is for the door to the final statue room, raising its DC from 18 to 99 so it's no longer an egregious exploit.

Blast Globe fix addition by kevL
v.160912

Black Garius + nightwalker fix by kevL
v.161003
At the defense of Crossroad Keep, when Black Garius is about to summon his nightwalker, he gets distracted and often doesn't complete his dialog successfully due to all the fighting going on in the courtyard. If the nightwalker does not summon, the plot breaks because it needs to be defeated for the plot to continue. This fix temporarily removes several of Black Garius' AI scripts related to combat, so that he does not react to being hit by arrows and so is no longer tempted to retaliate against the greycloaks that surround the barricade. This allows his dialog to complete and the nightwalker to be summoned correctly. His AI then returns to normal and the Battle of Crossroad Keep commences.

dialog fixes by kamal
v.170205
10_axle: Axle now correctly recognizes the classes (was an and check), and restored a line regarding the gith that could never happen
10_moire: previously a bluff check with Moire was not implemented when the dialog says there is one, so the bluff was always successful

script fix by kamal
v.170205
This is the deathscript for Fenthick, but it was in the wrong module, so it never fired. (This script does not seem to have any game effect)

Construct upgrade fix by player1

Deekin Keep Dialog fix by kevL
v.170207
Allows Deekin to upgrade his store (twice), allows any/all of his various greetings to show, and increases what he's willing to pay for items (instead of decreasing). WARNING: I arbitrarily decreased the increase from 10% to 5% on his initial store, then on Upgrade 1 it resets to 0% (stock), and on Upgrade 2 it jumps to its full 10% MarkUp/MarkDown (always in favor of the player).
